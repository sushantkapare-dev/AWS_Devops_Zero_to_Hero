## 1) How can you implement Infrastructure as code with Terraform in a CI/CD Pipeline

## 2) Difference between count and for-each

## 3) How do you implement a multi cloud infrastructure with Terraform

## 4) what is Terraform drift 

## 5) How to secure sensitive data in Terraform

## Q) What happens if your state file gets corrupted during a multi-cloud deployment?
Ans: Terraform can’t reconcile resources across AWS, Azure, and GCP. Each provider shows different resource states, and you’re stuck with infrastructure that exists in some clouds but not in Terraform’s memory.

## Q) What happens when your Terraform Cloud workspace runs out of credits mid-apply?
Ans: Your deployment stops immediately, leaving resources in various states of creation. Some EC2 instances are running, some security groups are half-configured, and your application is completely broken.

## Q)What happens if your team uses AI-generated Terraform code that creates naming conflicts?
Ans: ChatGPT creates resource names that seem fine in isolation but clash with existing infrastructure. Your apply fails with cryptic AWS errors about duplicate names, and you’re debugging AI code at 2 AM.
