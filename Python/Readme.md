# Python Emoji Fun 🐍🎉

Welcome to the Python Emoji Fun repository! 🚀 This project adds a touch of fun to your Python code by incorporating emojis into your scripts. Emojis not only make your code more visually appealing but also add a dash of personality. 😎

## Getting Started 🛠️

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-emoji-fun.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage 🚀

Simply import the `emojifun` module and start using emojis in your Python scripts!

```python
from emojifun import emoji_hello

emoji_hello()
```

This will print a friendly "Hello, World! 🌍" message with a cheerful emoji.

## Examples 🌈

### Emoji Calculator 🧮

from emojifun import emoji_add

result = emoji_add(5, 10)
print(f"The sum is: {result} 🎉")
```
